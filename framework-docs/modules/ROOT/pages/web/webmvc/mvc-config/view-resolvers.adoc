= View Resolvers

The MVC configuration simplifies the registration of view resolvers.

The following example configures content negotiation view resolution by using JSP and Jackson as a
default `View` for JSON rendering:

include-code::./WebConfiguration[tag=snippet,indent=0]

[NOTE]
====
Calling `registry.jsp()` registers an `InternalResourceViewResolver`
with a default prefix of `/WEB-INF/` and a suffix of `.jsp`.
Explicit configuration is only required if JSP files are located
in a different directory or use a different extension.
====


Note, however, that FreeMarker, Groovy Markup, and script templates also require
configuration of the underlying view technology. The following example works with FreeMarker:

include-code::./FreeMarkerConfiguration[tag=snippet,indent=0]
